# Using Jupyter Notebooks

1. Clone the repository. 
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/tturokk/dream-repo.git
~~~~
2. Next, we want to make sure we have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can either follow one of two paths. You can either install Anaconda (which installs Python, Jupyter Notebook, and a bunch of other useful computing libraries) or use pip.

- To install Anaconda, take a look at their [website](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which has some pretty great documentation. Use Anaconda it makes live much eaiser!

- If you want to install using pip, you'll need to update pip with the following code (Replace pip with pip3 if using Python 3). 

On Linux/Mac OS:
~~~~
pip install -U pip setuptools
~~~~

On Windows:
~~~~
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
~~~~

Next, you should be able to run the following. 
~~~~
pip install jupyter
~~~~

3. Finally, run the following command and a new tab in your browser with the Jupyter Notebook should come up
~~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~~
